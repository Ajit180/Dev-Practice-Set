Got it! Based on your approach of creating one parent `div`, here's the updated task for Day 1:

### **Day 1: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with DOM (Parent Div Approach)**

**Task: Build a Simple To-Do List App**

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Create a parent `<div>` element that will contain everything.
   - Inside the parent `<div>`, create:
     - An input field for adding new tasks.
     - A button to add the task to the list.
     - An empty `<ul>` or `<ol>` to hold the task list.
   - Make sure the input and button are positioned neatly within the parent div (you can use Flexbox or simply block-level elements).
   
2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Style the parent `<div>` and its child elements:
     - Use Flexbox or Grid to arrange the input field, button, and task list inside the parent `<div>`.
     - Style the button to make it look interactive (e.g., change color on hover).
     - Make the list of tasks visually appealing (e.g., use a different background color for each task or add borders).
     - Add padding and margins for a clean, centered layout.
   
3. **JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)**:
   - Add functionality with JavaScript:
     - When the user clicks the "Add Task" button, the task should be added to the `<ul>` as a new `<li>` element.
     - Each `<li>` should have a delete button next to it to remove the task from the list.
     - Make sure the input field is cleared after adding a task.
     - Add an event listener to the "Add Task" button to trigger the task creation.

4. **Bonus**:
   - Use **localStorage** to save the tasks, so they persist even when the page is refreshed.

This task follows your preference for using a parent `div` and makes use of **DOM manipulation**, **CSS styling**, and **JavaScript event handling**. Let me know if you need any more guidance!
